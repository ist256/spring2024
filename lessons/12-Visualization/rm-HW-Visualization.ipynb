    "# Homework: People Enslaved on Plantations in St. Lucia, 1815.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Murphy from the Maxwell school and I collaborated on a research project to build a searchable database of enslaved individuals from St. Lucia. The data came from a British census of the Caribbean island in 1815. Great Britain had recently secured the island in 1814 from the French following the Treaty of Paris ending the Napoleonic Wars. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project posed unique challenges as the census data were scanned pages of hand-written census data in French. The unique nature of the data made it difficult to automate so we used student volunteers to read the page and translate then transcribe the data into a spreadsheet, so we could then build the dataset. Here is an example of one of these pages:\n",

    "\n",
    "The impact of the project was significant. Before our work there was no searchable registry of individuals from this census. Our dataset, to be published to the Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation,  https://jsdp.enslaved.org, will be searchable by name as well as other characteristics. We are hoping people will use the dataset to help learn about the history of St. Lucia and make connections in their genealogical histories. \n",
