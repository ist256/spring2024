    "3. Click the link to download and install Kaltura Capture on **Windows** or **Mac**\n",
    "4. After it installed use it to record your screen, video and microphone.\n",

    "6. Edit the video and select **Publish** -> **Unlisted**\n",
    "7. Go to the **Share** tab on the video to get a link to the video you can share.\n",
    "8. Double-check you shared it properly! Ask a friend to open it or try viewing it on another device or in private mode.\n",
    "9. Copy the link and paste it here to share with your instructor.\n"
